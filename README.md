Designing chatbot personalities and figuring out how to achieve your business goals at the same time can be a daunting task. We‚Äôve compiled a list of chatbot design guidelines. You can scroll down to find some cool tips from the best chatbot design experts.

If you want to learn how to design a chatbot conversation, you need to practice. But it is going to be much easier if you try to avoid some common chatbot design mistakes.

Things to avoid when designing your chatbots:

    Pretending to be human
    Pointless banter 
    Messages that may appear rude
    Chatbot conversation scripts based only on NLP
    Typos and irritating grammar mistakes
    Messages that are too long

1. Make sure that what you need is a chatbot

Before you ask how to design a chatbot, you should ask yourself: Do I really need a chatbot for that?

The most important and often the hardest part of chatbot design is deciding if something should be a chatbot in the first place.

There are tasks that chatbots are suitable for‚Äîyou‚Äôll read about them soon. But there are also many situations where chatbots are an impractical gimmick at best.

In 2016 eBay introduced it‚Äôs ShopBot‚Äîa facebook messenger chatbot that was supposed to revolutionize online shopping. It seemed like a great idea and everyone was quite confident about the project.

Over a period of two years ShopBot managed to generate 37K likes‚Ä¶ at a time when eBay had more than 180 million users. But people didn‚Äôt really feel comfortable with placing an order via a chatbot.

The mobile app turned out to be more intuitive and useful than the chatbot. If you think about it, it is way easier to browse through products via a mobile app than describe what you are looking for to a chatbot. It may feel like playing Twenty Questions! 

Conversational interfaces were not built for navigating through countless product categories.

Chatbots can inform you about promotions or featured products. But if you sell many types of products, a regular search bar and product category pages may be better. Incorporating complex navigation into a chatbot interface is a bad idea.

Conversational user interfaces like Alexa, Siri or Google Assistant offer real-time assistance. They are extremely versatile and use advanced AI algorithms to determine what their user needs.

2. Choose the right platform and framework

There are many chatbot platforms and tools available online. You can use the majority of them in your browser as web apps. All you need to do is create an account.

Still, there are many things that can go wrong with your website chatbot design. Some chatbots can:

    Look weird on mobile devices
    Work only on few selected channels 
    Offer very limited personalization options

It may be a good idea to choose a platform that seamlessly integrates with your website or Facebook page.

 For example, with Tidio you can:

    Add a chatbot on websites powered by WordPress or Shopify by installing a plugin
    Use chatbots on any website by inserting a single line of auto-generated code snippet
    Integrate chatbots with Facebook Messenger or other messaging apps
    Create a unique chatbot landing page with a customizable URL (you can just send a link to anyone and open it in any browser)
    Use triggers or JavaScript API to connect chatbots with any kind of events happening on a website

If you want to use free chatbot design tools, it has a very intuitive editor.

3. Determine if you need AI and NLP or a simple decision tree chatbot

This is another difficult decision and a common beginner mistake. Most rookie chatbot designers jump in at the deep end and overestimate the usefulness of artificial intelligence. 

Conversational AI and Natural Language Processing are promising technologies. But‚Äî

Novice chatbot designers don‚Äôt take into account that machine learning works well only when we have lots of data to learn from. And you don‚Äôt have it when you are starting from scratch.

Chatbot design examples:
Good and bad example of chatbot design

Some chatbot apps, like Tidio, offer both types of bots. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that you should choose AI chatbots just because they are ‚Äúmore advanced.‚Äù

Here is the best way to approach the problem of insufficient data for your AI:

    Phase 1: Use live chat and analyze conversation scripts to discover the most common customer queries and messages
    Phase 2: Build a decision tree chatbot that helps to solve the essential problems and collect more data
    Phase 3: Use the data to create an additional AI bot equipped with intent detection to handle other things customers ask about

Phases of the customer support evolution

A clean and simple rule-based chatbot build‚Äîmade of buttons and decision trees‚Äîis 100x better than an AI chatbot without training.
4. Set up goals and stick to them

A good chatbot is designed to perform one task at a time. That‚Äôs the way customers like them too. No one wants their chatbot to change the subject in the middle of a conversation. 

It will tempt you to kill two or three birds with one stone. Sometimes it is possible but most of the time you should focus on one objective only.

    One trick is to start with designing the outcomes of the chatbot before thinking of the questions it‚Äôll ask.
    Dr. Saksham Sharda

Take a look at this example.
How to set up a chatbot with Tidio

Here, you can design your first chatbot by selecting one of pre-configured goals. But you can‚Äôt eat the cookie and have the cookie (but there is an easy trick I‚Äôll share with you in a moment).

The most popular chatbot goals are:

    Generating leads
    Showing featured products
    Booking meetings and demos
    Answering FAQs
    Rescuing abandoned shopping carts
    Collecting feedback

You can design complex chatbot workflows that will cover three or four of the aims mentioned above. However, it is better to use a dedicated chatbot for each and every goal.

For example, you can trigger a lead generation chatbot when somebody visits a specific page. Afterward, when the visitor scrolls down to the bottom of the page, another chatbot that collects reviews can pop up. This way you can combine several goals.

5. Consider the tone and voice

Most chatbots will not be able to accurately judge the emotions or intentions of their conversation partners.

Take a look at this poor, clueless bot:
Poor chatbot design example

A real person would adjust their tone accordingly. However, a cheerful chatbot will most likely remain cheerful even when you tell it that your hamster just died.

If you want to hear the truth‚Äî

You don‚Äôt need to worry about it. A fixed tone is a good thing. You don‚Äôt need to always mimic human conversations.

With a chatbot that has a clear objective, it shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. Once you decide on a specific purpose, choose the appropriate message tone and chatbot personality. Some users won‚Äôt play along but you need to focus on your perfect user and their goals. 

When designing your chatbot conversations, choose from the following tone qualities:
Table with different tones of voice

Are you designing a chatbot for a mental health website? It should probably be sympathetic, respectful, and friendly.

Maybe your chatbot is supposed to increase sales. OK. It should be persuasive, energetic, and spiced up with a dash of urgency.

Choose between 3-5 of the most desired characteristics. You can also select some of the ones to avoid. It will make your messages more interesting and consistent.

If you want to be sure you‚Äôre sticking to the right tone, you can also check your messages with dedicated apps. Here is a tone detector tool from Grammarly.

What‚Äôs the difference between tone and voice?
The tone is an expression of attitude in a given situation. Voice is linked with general character and personality. Find more about the differences here: Why Are Brand Voice and Brand Tone of Voice Important?

You should also think about your target users. The same chatbot can be perceived as helpful and knowledgeable by one group of users and as patronizing by another.

Great chatbot design always puts end users first. Consider criteria such as their:

    Age
    Gender
    Education
    Native language
    Technical skills
    Profession
    Health

6. See to it your chatbot UI is friendly and readable

Designing chatbot personalities is hard but allows you to be creative. On the other hand, nobody will talk to a chatbot that has an impractical UI.

It‚Äôs important to consider all the contexts in which people will talk to our chatbot. For example, it may turn out that your message input box will blend with the background of a website. Or messages will become unreadable if they are too dark or light and users decide to switch the color mode.

Poor UX example:
Poor chatbot design example

If you want your chatbot UI to work, make sure that:

    It is easy to read all messages and scroll up and down
    The chatbot widget does not interfere with other elements of a website
    It is easy to start the conversation again from the beginning
    It‚Äôs clear when to write and when to click a button or take other actions
    The conversation panel displays correctly on mobile devices
    The design follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

Website chatbot design is no different from regular front-end development. But if you don‚Äôt want to design a chatbot UI in HTML and CSS, use an out-of-the-box chatbot solution. Most of the potential problems with UI will already be taken care of.

7. Tell your customers that they‚Äôre talking to a chatbot

Chatbots can‚Äôt pretend to be human for very long. The users see that something suspicious is going on right off the bat. If someone discovers they are talking to a robot only after some time, it becomes all the more frustrating.

The best policy?

Say it right at the very beginning of the conversation. For example, in your welcome message.
Tidio's bot welcome message example

The sooner users know they are writing with a chatbot, the lower the chance for misunderstandings.

In the long run, there is really no point in hiding the fact that the messages are sent automatically. It will even work to your advantage‚Äîyour visitors will know they can expect a quick response as soon as they type in their questions.

8. Keep chatbot conversation flows simple and to the point

It is very easy to fall down the rabbit hole when you are working on your chatbot design.

You feel like you can anticipate every potential question and every way the conversation might unfold.

I know the thrill! But before you know it, it‚Äôs five in the morning and you‚Äôre preparing elaborate answers to totally random questions. You know, just in case users decide to ask the chatbot about its favorite color.

You‚Äôll probably end up with something like this terrible chatbot design example:

Zoom out and you‚Äôll see that this is just a small fragment of an even bigger chatbot flow. This chatbot interaction design tries to cover too much ground.

You‚Äôre probably tempted to design a chatbot that would be able to entertain dinner guests and show off its knowledge of numerous topics. But ask yourself if it makes any business sense. And if your chatbot really needs to be that complex.

Try to map out the potential outcomes of the conversation and focus on those that overlap with the initial goals of your chatbot.

9. Use visuals for better effect

Most channels where you can use chatbots also allow you to send GIFs and images. Emojis and images are very popular in private conversations. If you want the conversations with your chatbot to have a similar, informal feel, consider decorating it with nice visuals.

You can use memes and GIFs just the same way you would during a chat with a friend. It can add more oomph to your messages. A nice animation can make a joke land better or give a visual confirmation of certain actions. It creates great conversational experiences.

Here is an example:
Chatbot design example that includes a gif

This chatbot uses emojis, animated GIFs, and it sends messages with a slight delay. This allows you to control exactly how the conversation with the user moves forward. The pacing and the visual hooks make customers more engaged and drawn into the exchange of messages.

Adding visual buttons and decision cards makes the interaction with your chatbot easier.

    I have seen this mistake made over and over again; websites will have chatbots that are just plain text, with no graphical elements. It‚Äôs disengaging, and I didn‚Äôt know what the chatbot was trying to achieve. It is an absolute must to add in images, cards, and buttons, even where there normally wouldn‚Äôt be in a text conversation.

10. A/B test your chatbots to see which messages work

Play around with the messages and images used in your chatbots. It‚Äôs good to experiment and find out what type of message resonates with your website visitors.

You can use external tools like VWO or trigger two versions of your chatbot with Tidio Chatbot API. If you want to learn more about AB tests you may find these resources useful:

It is very easy to clone chatbot designs and make some slight adjustments. You can trigger custom chatbots in different versions and connect them with your Google Analytics account. It is also possible to create your own user tags and monitor performance of specific chatbot templates or custom chatbot designs.

It may turn out that a more aggressive approach can improve your engagement or sales. Here‚Äôs what Kevin Cook from On the Map discovered:

    If the chat box overtakes the page after 10 seconds, you will see engagements shoot through the roof. It goes against everything we care about and is an annoyingly true statistic. It‚Äôs invasive and aggressive, but it really does work.
    Kevin Cook
    Chief Product Owner, On the Map Inc.

You can try out some of the following experiments and see what is more engaging to your visitors. You can A/B test chatbots:

    With or without an avatar
    With quick reply buttons or open-ended questions
    With benefit-oriented messages or messages that offer assistance
    That use pre-chat survey or ask for emails only during chats

11. Design a chatbot avatar that matches its personality

Designing chatbot personalities is extremely difficult when you have to do it with just a few short messages. That‚Äôs why chatbot avatars come in really handy.

A cool chatbot avatar is like the icing on the cake. It‚Äôs a nice touch that makes it more memorable and fun to interact with. When users see a character‚Äîeven if it is just a cartoon dog or a robot‚Äîit is much easier to channel their emotions.

Still, you should be careful. If we use a chatbot instead of an impersonal and abstract interface, people will connect with it on a deeper level. It means that it will be easier to get angry at it too.
Microsoft's virtual assistant - Clippy

I have given a name to my pain, and it is Clippy‚Ä¶

Many people hated Clippy, the overly-helpful Microsoft Office virtual assistant. Let‚Äôs face it‚Äî working on documents can sometimes be a frustrating experience. When the tool dangled a mascot in front of them, it was adding insult to the injury. If you know that your chatbot will talk mostly with the users who are upset, a cute chatbot avatar won‚Äôt help. It may be better to use a solution that is more neutral and impersonal.

Here are several interesting examples of memorable chatbot avatar designs.

Some of them are robots, some are cute animals. Some are both. 

Is it a robot squirrel? A squirrel robot?

In any case‚Äî

The horror. The horror.

The hard truth is that the best chatbots are the ones that are most useful. We usually don‚Äôt remember interacting with them because it was effortless and smooth.

How can this be?

Good design doesn‚Äôt draw attention to itself but makes the user experience better. It is perfectly acceptable that at times the best avatar for a chatbot is a neutral one. Or no avatar whatsoever. There are many great chatbot designs that don‚Äôt use anything resembling a face or a character.

12. Leave a possibility to contact a human support agent too

It is important to decide if something should be a chatbot and when it should not. That‚Äôs what the first tip was about. But it is also equally important to know when a chatbot should retreat and hand the conversation over.

What‚Äôs the worst-case scenario in chatbot design?

The user can‚Äôt get the right information from the chatbot despite numerous efforts. It is deeply frustrating and happens all too often. 

It is perfectly OK for your chatbot to say: I‚Äôm sorry but I can‚Äôt help you. Would you like to contact a live chat agent? 

Your chatbot, especially if it is one of your first projects, will need your help from time to time. But you can create a very smooth workflow for emergencies. You can set up mobile notifications that will pop up on your phone and allow you to take the conversation over in 10s.

For many companies, chatbots work like digital speed bumps. Their primary goal is to keep visitors a little longer on a website and find out what they want.

    We use our chatbot to filter visitors as a receptionist would do. Through the chatbot, we are able to determine whether a person really likes to chat with a live agent, or if they are only looking around.
